Tracking my thoughts and questions throughout the lifetime of this project.

Initial purpose:
Currently studying a technical course to learn entry-level programming: SQL, Javascript, and C#.
I learn best through trial-and-error, working to solve problems... as opposed to reading documentation and follow-along courses.
This project is self-proposed challenge to build a simple website using the knowledge I have gained so far.

Desired outcomes:
- Understand how a front-end application communicates with back-end software and a database.
- Gain practical experience working with the all three components of building a web application.
- Learn how to integrate the three components together - at current, I have no understanding how these will work together. Each component is taught as an isolated subject in my enrolled course.

Questions/Thoughts:
1. How does front-end and back-end differ?
2. How do they work together?
3. How will JavaScript communicate with C Sharp?
4. How will C Sharp communicate with the database?
5. How will I ensure user security?
6. What am I trying to achieve here?
7. What will be the goal and how will I know I've completed the project or succeeded?
8. How long will this take?
9. Should I use libraries/APIs to speed up the process or start from scratch for more in-depth and thorough understanding?
